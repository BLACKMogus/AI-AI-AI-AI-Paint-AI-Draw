收集了我知道的关于AI绘画或者上色方面技术，仅限二次元
This project include the AI technology I know for characters generation or pictures painting.（Only Animation）

1.AI绘画/AI painting  
name：PI-REC  
link：https://github.com/youyuge34/PI-REC  
Introduction:  
We propose a universal image reconstruction method to represent detailed images purely from binary sparse edge and flat color domain. Here is the open source code and the drawing tool.   
*The codes of training for release are no completed yet, also waiting for release license of lab.

2.角色生成/Characters generation   
name：Crypko   
link：https://crypko.ai/  
Introduction：  
Using Gan (generation countermeasure network) technology, crypko ™ It can automatically generate high-quality animation vertical drawing.
By learning the features of the image, the model can be transformed freely and coherently in the endless space of thousands of paintings.

4.模仿绘画/Imitation painting    
name：ICCV2019-Learning to Paint   
link：https://github.com/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint  
Introduction：  
We show how to teach machines to paint like human painters, who can use a small number of strokes to create fantastic paintings. By employing a neural renderer in model-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), our agents learn to determine the position and color of each stroke and make long-term plans to decompose texture-rich images into strokes. Experiments demonstrate that excellent visual effects can be achieved using hundreds of strokes. The training process does not require the experience of human painters or stroke tracking data.

official website：https://nearcyan.com/this-anime-does-not-exist/  
Introduction：  
This Anime Does Not Exist was launched on January 19th, showcasing almost a million images (n=900,000 at launch, now n=1,800,000 images), every single one of which was generated by Aydao‘s Stylegan2 model. For an in-depth write-up on the progression of the field of anime art generation as well as techniques, datasets, past attempts, and the machine learning details of the model used, please read Gwern’s post. This post is a more concise and visual post discussing the website itself, thisanimedoesnotexist.ai, including more images, videos, and statistics.

official website：https://www.gwern.net/TWDNE 
Introduction：  
Generating high-quality anime faces has long been a task neural networks struggled with. The invention of StyleGAN in 2018 has effectively solved this task and I have trained a StyleGAN model which can generate high-quality anime faces at 512px resolution. To show off the recent progress, I made a website, “This Waifu Does Not Exist” for displaying random StyleGAN 2 faces. TWDNE displays a different neural-net-generated face & plot summary every 15s. The site was popular and went viral online, especially in China. The model can also be used interactively for exploration & editing in the Artbreeder online service⁠.

7.自动上色/Automatic coloring    
name：style2paints

link2：https://github.com/lllyasviel/style2paints    
Introduction：  
The AI can paint on a sketch, obeying your instructions.  
The AI can paint on a sketch according to a given specific color style.  
The AI can create its own color style to paint on a sketch.  
The AI can transfer illustrations' style.  
We focus on interactivity, possibility and creativity.
